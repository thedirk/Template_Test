# Template_Test
A test template repo for speech corpus collection

# Naming 

1) "stt-3333-4-5-6##-7-8-99" is the naming convention for an entry in the speech-to-text training data corpus. This code is easy to generate---go through your metadata sheet step-by-step, and enter the values in order. Double check to make sure they are correct before hitting enter! 

2) "stt" is the project code. It stands for "Speech-to-text" training data. All of your entries should begin with this project code. 

3) "3333" is the birth year for the primary subject of the transcript. 

4) "4" is the code for the subject's gender: 

* P = male 
* M = female 
* X = other 

5) "5" is the code for the subject's location: 

* D = Dharamsala
* L = Ladakh
* S = South India 
* N = Nepal 

6) "6##" is the code for the subject's education type + the number of years attended (if years are split among categories, report the category that has the most years; for years, report the total years; use two digits, for example, 00, 01, 02, ... 10, 11, 12...): 

* G = monastic
* B = Tibetan school 
* L = Indian school (or other public / private school) 
* N = None

7) "7" is the code for the subject's occupation. For children, this will almost always be "L" (student): 

* M = unemployed / not working 
* L = student
* B = nomad
* Z = farmer
* S = crafts / artist / manual labor (blue collar)
* N = police / guard / military
* R = monastic
* J = employee (white collar) 
* P = doctor / health 
* G = teacher / education 
* X = other

8) "8" is the code for the subject's basic literacy: 
* Y = literate 
* M = illiterate

9) "99" is an optional field. If your entry has the exact same metadata of a repo that's already been created, you may add extra digits here. Start with "00" and continue with "01", "02", etc., as needed.
